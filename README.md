# Plans
1.Replying and forwarding messages.<br />
2.Voice and video messages, location sharing.<br />
3.Ability to send photos, videos, documents and links. <br />
4.Previews of attached videos, documents, links. <br />
5.Different levels of message persistence (from strict persistence to "store until delivered" to purely ephemeral messaging).<br />



# Development pattern for contributors

1.Create a fork of the main FastChat repository on GitHub. <br />
2.Make your changes in a branch named something different from master, e.g. create a new branch my-pull-request.<br />
3.Create a pull request.
